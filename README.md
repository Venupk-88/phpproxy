PHP-Proxy
=========

PHP-Proxy is a script written in PHP that acts as a proxy to be used for the purpose of fetching Internet's resources on behalf of the server and returning its contents back to the client. PHP-Proxy was built to be fast and simple to configure and as an alternative to Glype


PHP-Proxy vs PHPProxy
---------------------

This proxy script has no relationship to the once popular PHPProxy project by whitefyre.com which [has been abandoned since September 2007](http://sourceforge.net/projects/poxy/). There are many similar function proxy scripts named "PHP Proxy", we were just the lucky ones to acquire such domain name. While PHPProxy is still being widely used, it is outdated, hard to customize and it breaks on many popular websites such as Facebook and YouTube.
